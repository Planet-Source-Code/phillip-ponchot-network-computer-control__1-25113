## Network Computer Control


</div>

### Description

If you are a network administration taking care of

labs, this tool can be indispensable. Although

it takes some work to configure the tool, it pings

up to 200 computers and with a gui shows the

good/bad status of the computers. I use it to

track over 170 "public" computers.  Although

there are other ping programs out there, the gui

on this one is better than having the data in a

listbox and looks pretty neat, even if I say so

myself.

This is an upgrade to my orginal submission.

This upgrade resizes the form depending on the

number of computers configured.
 
### More Info
 
Ips.txt file that has a listing of computer names

and ip addresses.

Ips.txt must be configured either in a word

processing program capable of making dos text files

or via the program itself.

Returns whether a ping was returned.
