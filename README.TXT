This program is designed to monitor up to 200 computers.  If you put more
than 200 entries into the ips.txt file, I imagine that there will be an
array error.

If you configure the ips.txt file with the wordpad (which is the default
program), you must save in in a MSDos Format.

If the program gives an error (array error), then more than likely there is
an error in the ips.txt file or it was not saved in the MSDos Format.

You can correct this by editing the file with edit.com in dos or reopening
the file in wordpad and fixing how you saved it.

This program will not work with only one computer name and address in the
ips.txt.  This is because of the graphic that I coded in to move the bmp
with the question mark from picture to picture.  If there is only one, the
bmp remains displayed in the only picture.  It could be fixed easily enough.

The idea of this software is mine, but most of the code came from many
Planet-source-code.com example sources many of whom I do not remember. I
work as a Network guy and programming is a hobby for me.

I thank everyone for sharing and if I have left your name out, please
contact me so I can give you credit (pponchot@unf.edu).

I am also sharing this idea and you are free to use it.  I have created
a better one than this.  It also allows the program to also act as a server
and to do the following to one or all the computers in the ips.txt:

1.  Send a message.
2.  Lock the computer with a full screen program. (We use it to lock the
computers at closing time).
3.  Reboot the computers (can be changed to shutdown the computers).

This upgraded program has a client side that must run.

Hang in there,

Phillip
